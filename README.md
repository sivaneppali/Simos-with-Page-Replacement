                                   CS 5348 Operating Systems -- Project 4# Simos-with-Page-Replacement

Simulated Operating System which replaces the simple memory manager with a simulated virtual memory demand paging scheme.

We need to replace the simple memory manager with a simulalted virtual memory
demand paging scheme. We should complete the implementation in “swap.c”, “paging.c”, and “loader.c” to
realize the demand paging scheme. We can implement the system in three
phases.

Testing
The model system can be tested by generating our own input programs and change the parameters specified in config.sys to
thoroughly test your memory manager implementation.
